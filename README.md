# ExploreExtend

ExploreExtend is a web application that aims to make travel and tourism easier for adventurers and explorers. Inspired by Veronica Verma's adventurous expedition, this application provides a platform for users to plan their trips, get daily updates, and hire guides to enhance their travel experiences.

## Project Description

Although quite adventurous, Veronica Verma's expedition into the unknown world was neither easy nor predictable. Considering that our protagonist manages to reach back to the world she had departed from safely, she is excited to narrate her experience to everyone there. With innumerable challenges she faced along the way, Veronica Verma wished to make this trip easier for anyone who would follow. And so she decided to build this travel and tour website.
